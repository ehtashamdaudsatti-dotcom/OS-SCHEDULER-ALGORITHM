# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

A professional web-based CPU Scheduling Simulator built using **React.js**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js**. This project simulates four popular CPU Scheduling Algorithms and displays their execution using Gantt Charts, Process Tables, Waiting Time, and Turnaround Time.

## Algorithms Included

### 1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)

Processes are executed in the order they arrive.

### 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)

Processes are executed based on the shortest burst time.

### 3. Priority Scheduling

Processes are executed according to their priority.

### 4. Round Robin Scheduling

Processes are executed using a fixed time quantum.
